## The software works as follows: 

1. Read a list of x, y coordinates from a comma-separated values (CSV) file and create a polygon object from them. The points are provided in clockwise order.
2. Read a list of x, y coordinates from a file and create a list of point objects for testing.
3. Categorise these points and write into a file whether they are: "inside,", "outside,", or "boundary" 
4. Write the result of each point in a CSV file. 
5. Plot the points and polygons in a plot window.
